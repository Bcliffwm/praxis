# Product Overview

This is a Praxis project focused on "Enhancing Document Summarization for Research Portfolio Development with GraphRAG".

## Purpose
The project extracts academic research data from OpenAlex API and builds a graph database using Neo4j to enable GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for document summarization and research portfolio analysis.

## Key Components
- Data extraction from OpenAlex API for academic works, authors, topics, institutions, publishers, and funders
- CSV data processing and validation using Pydantic models
- Neo4j graph database ingestion for relationship modeling
- Research paper relationship mapping and citation analysis

## Target Use Case
Academic researchers and institutions looking to analyze research portfolios, discover relationships between works, authors, and topics, and generate enhanced document summaries using graph-based retrieval methods.
