# Product Overview

This is a Praxis project focused on "Enhancing Document Summarization for Research Portfolio Development with GraphRAG".

## Purpose
The project implements a research data analysis pipeline that:
- Extracts academic research data using PyAlex API
- Stores and queries data in Neo4j graph database
- Uses AWS Bedrock and Strands agents for AI-powered document summarization
- Applies GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques for research portfolio development

## Key Components
- **Data Collection**: Academic works, authors, institutions, topics, publishers, and funders
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for storing relationships between research entities
- **AI Agents**: Strands framework with AWS Bedrock models for summarization
- **Analysis Environment**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and prototyping

## Target Use Case
Academic researchers and institutions looking to analyze research portfolios, identify collaboration patterns, and generate summaries of research domains using graph-based AI techniques.
